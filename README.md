# Python-Code-of-Pulse-Echo-project
Project: Acoustic Attenuation in Vibration-Damping Alloys(Automatic code to detect acoustic attenuation and speed in cpmposite alloys).
•	Utilized Python programming for the analysis and visualization of Pulse-Echo data.
•	Developed Python code to automatically identify individual echoes within a pulse of Pulse-Echo Data.
•	Employed advanced algorithms for accurate and efficient echo detection.
•	Implemented code to perform correlation analysis between the 1st echo and consecutive echoes.
•	Utilized correlation results to calculate the time delay between echoes.
•	Leveraged the calculated time delay to determine the velocity of the acoustic wave in the material.
•	Computed the attenuation coefficient based on the obtained data.
•	Ensured automation in the process, enhancing the efficiency of echo identification and analysis.
•	Improved accuracy through systematic correlation analysis.
•	Obtained valuable insights into the acoustic properties of the material under examination.
•	Results contribute to a better understanding of the velocity and attenuation coefficient of the acoustic wave. Using attenuation and velocity, we ncan relate engineering damping and 
quality factor of any composite alloy.
